# Import-of-goods-under-Saudi-VAT
When the goods are imported by persons residing in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the buyers are obliged to pay GAZT (General Authority of Zakat &amp; Taxation) with a reverse payment. Let us understand the methods to be used by both registered and unregistered businesses to pay VAT on imports.  1. Import by VAT registered businesses in Saudi Arabia  When a business registered in Saudi VAT imports from a non-GCC country, it is obliged to pay VAT to the Customs Department upon receipt of imported goods to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In addition, when a registered business imports goods from a GCC country that cannot provide VAT has been paid in the country of origin, the business must pay VAT to the Customs Department at the arrival of the goods imported to KSA.  2. Import by unregistered businesses under Saudi VAT  If an unregistered business or private person has imported goods from another GCC country and cannot prove that VAT has been paid in the country of origin, then the person must pay VAT to the Customs Department at the time of arrival in KSA.
